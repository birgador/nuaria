					"Substitutes are constructs made to be better than the humanoids they imitate. They look and act exactly as the species they copy, and in most cases, are exemplary at all tasks they perform. Their true form is a texture of rich red blood that when struck, reacts like hardened clay. Luckily for these disguised constructs, only severe damage is enough to reveal their true nature— an impressive feat unto itself, considering their many defenses. ",
					"The substitute were the concept of a powerful spellcaster from a long-lost bygone era. Texts on their creation are thought to be lost, but several contemporary wizards claim to have unlocked the secret to creating these immensely powerful constructs. Most believe, the secret in their construction lies within further researching simulacrum and similar magic. Whether or not any spellcasters remain alive to create these being is unknown. What is known, is that the substitute live among the settlements of humanity. Perhaps 1 in 200,000 could be one of these hidden constructs, but even that small fear is enough to motivate dedicated hunters and researchers to rooting them out.",
					"Most surviving substitutes are solitary beings, content with being left alone in their mundane existences. They prefer to maintain simple jobs in rural communities. Before their immortality can be called into question, they move to another community, citing reasons like “my brother in the big city is sick, and I’ve got to tend to him.”. Some substitutes even return to towns they’ve previously lived in, often centuries later. When they arrive, they still bear a striking resemblance to the faces on old portraits kept in the dusty and forgotten attics of townsfolk. Regardless of their wandering nature, most substitutes wish no ill upon humanoid races, and instead seek to enrich themselves with repeated lifetimes of experience. ",
					"Eventually, the mundane isn’t enough for a substitute. Some take on the role of adventurers, finding their lifetimes of unexciting jobs give them ample experience for such tasks. Unlike the life of a craftsman, it’s hard for adventuring substitutes to maintain the illusion about their true nature. Substitutes spend long periods of time determining which adventurers would be suitable to learn their true nature. Many times, substitutes abandon their mundane lives to adventure alongside the grown descendant of a friend from a former life, seeking to protect the offspring of those who once showed them kindness.",
					"The oddest actions of substitutes are the inexplicable need to create their own settlements. Settlements founded and run by substitutes are often referred to as false settlements. In these rare situations, several substitutes come together and share their lifetimes of experience, deciding as a group that it would be best if they were entrusted to lead. They use their power and lifetimes of gathered resources to found new settlements, where they take on all the major roles of leadership. In some cases, these false settlements are utopian societies, guided by powerful overseers who refuse to reveal their true nature. In other instances, the substitutes leaders grow tired of living yet another ‘mundane life’ and instead perform twisted social experiments on the people of their settlements. As effectively immortal constructs, many substitutes have run both sides of the spectrum—creating utopias in one millennia, only to create maddening torture towns in another."

This nightmarish creation stands at approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) in height, bearing a childlike presence that conceals its malevolent nature. Its pale, translucent skin and unnerving, empty black eyes give it an eerie, otherworldly appearance. With a mouth filled with needle-like teeth, elongated bony fingers ending in razor-sharp claws, and wispy hair cascading down its back, the Little Whisper wears tattered remnants of children's clothing, presenting a hauntingly innocent facade.",
					"This undead monstrosity possesses a perpetual shadowy aura that allows it to move stealthily and blend seamlessly into the darkness. It employs an unsettling high-pitched shriek to disorient and terrify its victims. The Little Whisper excels in stealthy assassinations and kidnappings, making it a formidable tool for necromancers seeking to strike swiftly and silently, leaving behind only a trail of terror and death. Its ability to inspire fear and its penchant for vanishing into shadows make it a chilling and deadly adversary."
