				"Once the dragons of the Chamber employed agents that drew power from the Draconic Prophecy as a divine force itself. They acted throughout the Last War to prevent the Lords of Dust from freeing the Overlords. Their subtle works went unsung and as the Last War came to a close the need for the clerics of the Draconic Prophecy faded, and so did the agents. Now as the new millennium approaches Khorvaire has become a powder keg that could explode into war again. The need for such clerics is suddenly renewed. Now the Lords of Dust have also raised their own clerics of the Prophecy. Some clerics of the Draconic Prophecy consider themselves servants of fate, while others think of themselves as the directors of fate.",
